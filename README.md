The following codes have been used to analyze data in a study comparing two groups undergoing an intervention which was evaluated in three steps. 
Data were gathered in an Excel file. Descriptive analysis alongside MANOVA, Post-Hoc, and Bonferroni correction was done. Also, Bar plots with SE were drawn.

The word "PATH" in the code, returns to the path where your Excel file is saved. Also, I used the word "VAR" as a variation which was numbered VAR1, VAR2, and VAR3, and described the three steps of my data gathering.
